    "\n",
    "The main problem encountered when running the scraper is the long runtime for a relatively small dataset of around 500 data cells. The bottleneck occurs when parsing the whole page to look for the link to the sports reference website for each player in order to acquire their respective college stats. This is very inefficient as having to parse the whole page for every player leads to a long runtime. A better solution would be to use another data scraping framework such as Scrapy which allows data extraction using [selectors] (https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html). Extracting the link to sports-reference website of the page using the XPath or CSS selector would be much quicker than parsing the entire page. However as this scraper would only need to be run once it is not a major concern in our project to optimize and rewrite another scraper."
