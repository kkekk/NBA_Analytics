This is the repository for our project for CE9010 Introduction to Data Science. Project done by Cai Xin Qing and Yeo Ngee Chong.

- Data Scraper written in BeautifulSoup to scrape data from basketballreference.com and sportsreference.com
- Linear Regression model from sklearn used to model the predictor
- K fold cross validation done with 4 folds to predict hyper parameters

Unfortunately, we feel our model lacks sufficient data (only 400) to have an accurate enough prediction.
