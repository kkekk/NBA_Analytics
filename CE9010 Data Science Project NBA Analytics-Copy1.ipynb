    "Our main goal of our is to predict the impact of college prospects in the first and second year of NBA based on their college stats. Hence we choose to use their advanced stats available in college (ws, ws/40min) to generalize the impact on NBA measured in their advanced stats available in the NBA (per, ws, ws/48, bpm, vorp) for their first two years in the league. We chose to extract data from 1996 as college advanced statistics were only available from the 1995 season onwards. We also chose to only include the first 30 draft picks of each draft as players beyond the 30th picks usually do not play significant minutes in their teams.\n",

    "The main problem encountered when running the scraper is the long runtime for a relatively small dataset est <200? confirm again>. The bottleneck occurs when parsing the whole page to look for the link to the sports reference website for each player in order to acquire their respective college stats. Having to parse the whole page for every player leads to a long runtime; inefficient code. A better solution would be to use another data scraping framework such as Scrapy which allows data extraction using [selectors](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/selectors.html). Extracting the link to sports-reference website of the page using the XPath or CSS selector would be much quicker than parsing the entire page. However as this scraper would only need to be run once it is not a major concern to optimize and rewrite another scraper."
